# Ultimate Tic-Tac-Toe
This project is an Ultimate-Tic-Tac-Toe game made for Podstawy informatyki i programowania classses at Warsaw University of Technology.

## Setup
After cloning this repository, just execute `main.py`. All dependencies are included in Python standard library.

## Gameplay
Recommended board size is 3x3. As I checked 5x5 should fit in full screen terminal as well, however, bigger sizes won't.
There are three modes available:
1. Player vs Player
2. Player vs Random bot
3. Player vs "Smart" bot
